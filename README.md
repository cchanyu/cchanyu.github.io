### Notes:

Hello,
I'm finally updating my portfolio site.
The previous version had a game console concept.
However, there were feedbacks regarding poor responsiveness
and hard to navigate at first glance, and I agree to both.
As a result, I wasn't leaving a good impression to recruiters.

This one is still work in progress.
However, it's a lot more responsive and easy to navigate.

There's still a lot left to implement.
Including hooking up the backend to the firebase.

And implementing Google Auth to prevent strangers 
from submitting contact form or viewing the resume.

That's all I have for now.
Thank you for visiting and feel free to leave comments.
